## This branch is experimental.

This branch is for experimenting with FTDI USB serial chips.
Currently implemented: sending/receiving, setting baud rate, and setting latency timer.

No thorough test has been done. Should work with FT231X chips at least.
Multiple devices (via hubs) would work, as the main branch supports them.
